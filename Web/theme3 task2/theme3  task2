                   <h3><a style="color: black" class="six6"  href="">Khabib to Conor: "It is the same thing"</a> </h3> 
                   <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov is done with Conor McGregor, and he thinks that MMA should be as well.

                      Nurmagomedov, the former UFC Lightweight Champion and owner of a 29-0 record in UFC competition, explained that the broken leg McGregor suffered in the first round of his defeat against Dustin Poirier would hamper his ability to return to the top of the sport. As such, he thinks that the UFC should move on from the 32-year-old Irish boxer.

                      "Without broken legs, yes, [he could be the same]," Nurmagomedov said, per ESPN's Brett Okamoto. "But with broken legs, he's never going to kick the same. With him, no, I don't believe [he'll return to the top]. Conor have good age [32], but what happened with his mind, legs — this guy is finished, but he's good for promotion."</p>
